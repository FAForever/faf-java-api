This folder contains emails in the MailJet Markup language (see https://mjml.io/).

**They need to be processed with the MJML tools (e.g. IDE integrations). There is not automation currently.**

Once "compiled", the resulting html needs to be put into the right configuration places.
As of now these are (by default):

* /config/mail/account-activation.html
* /config/mail/welcome.html
* /config/mail/password-reset.html
